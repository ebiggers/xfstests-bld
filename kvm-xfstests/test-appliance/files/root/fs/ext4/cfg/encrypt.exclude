ext4/004	# dump/restore doesn't handle quotas

# These tests try to create extended attributes which are
# large enough to stress the limits of the available
# xattr size.  This causes problems with encryption
# which requires its own xattrs which take space.

# These tests use the old-style quota support where the quota files are user
# files instead of hidden inodes.  This isn't compatible with
# test_dummy_encryption, as it causes the quota files to be encrypted.
